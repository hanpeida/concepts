\begin{problem}
  A weight is dropped from the top of a building.  Ignoring air
  resistance, when the weight is halfway between the top of the
  building and the ground, it is travelling at $v$ m/s.  Just before
  the weight hits the ground, how fast is the weight moving?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice[correct]{More than $2v$ m/s}
    \choice{Exactly $2v$ m/s}
    \choice{Less than $2v$ m/s}
  \end{multipleChoice}
\end{problem}
