\begin{problem}
  Say a function ``misses zero'' if there is no number $x$ so that
  $f(x) = 0$.  Among functions which miss zero, how large can $1/f(x)$
  be?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{If a given function $f$ misses zero, then $1/f(x)$ can be made as large as desired.}
    \choice[correct]{There are functions which miss zero, and yet for all $x$, it is the case that $1/f(x) < 1$.}
    \choice{The quantity $1/f(x)$ is undefined for functions $f$ which miss zero.}
  \end{multipleChoice}
