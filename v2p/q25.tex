	Let $f$ be the function defined by $f(x) = \sqrt[4]{x^4}$, and
        $g$ be the function defined by the rule $g(y) = |y|$.
	\begin{multipleChoice}
		\choice{Since $f$ and $g$ have differing domain, they are different functions}
		\choice[correct]{$f$ and $g$ are the same function}
		\choice{$f$ and $g$ are different functions because they disagree for some inputs in their common domain}
		\choice{$f$ and $g$ are different functions because they are of different variables}
