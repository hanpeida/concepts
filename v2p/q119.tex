  Suppose a continuous function $f$ with domain the real numbers has infinitely many local minima.  What is true of $f$?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice[correct]{$f$ has infinitely many local maxima.}
    \choice{$f(x)$ can be made as large as desired by choosing appropriate $x$}
    \choice{$f(x)$ can be made as small as desired by choosing appropriate $x$}
    \choice{None of these statements are true.}
