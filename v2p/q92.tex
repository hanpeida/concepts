\begin{problem}

  A slow freight train chugs along a straight track.  The distance it
  has traveled after $x$ hours is given by a function $f(x)$.  An
  engineer is walking along the top of the box cars at the rate of $3$
  mi/hr in the same direction as the train is moving.  The speed of
  the man relative to the ground is
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{$f(x)+3$}
    \choice[correct]{$f'(x)+3$}
    \choice{$f(x)-3$}
    \choice{$f'(x)-3$}
  \end{multipleChoice}
