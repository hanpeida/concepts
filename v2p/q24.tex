	Let $f$ be the function defined by $f(a) = \frac{a^2}{a}$, and $g$ be the function defined by the rule $g(z) = \frac{b^3}{b^2}$. 
	\begin{multipleChoice}
		\choice{Since $f$ and $g$ have differing domain, they are different functions}
		\choice[correct]{$f$ and $g$ are the same function}
		\choice{$f$ and $g$ are different functions because they disagree for some inputs in their common domain}
		\choice{$f$ and $g$ are different functions because they are of different variables}
	\end{multipleChoice}
