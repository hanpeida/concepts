	Let $f$ and $g$ be two functions satisfying the relationship $f(x) = g(4x)$.  Suppose the point$(2,3)$ is on the graph of $f$.
	\begin{multipleChoice}
		\choice{The point $(\frac{1}{2},3)$ is on the graph of $g$}
		\choice[correct]{The point $(8, 3)$ is on the graph of $g$}
		\choice{The point $(8, 12)$ is on the graph of $g$}
		\choice{The point $(\frac{1}{2}, 12)$ is on the graph of $g$}
	\end{multipleChoice}
