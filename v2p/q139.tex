\begin{problem}
  Suppose $f$ is differentiable and $f(0) = 0$ and suppose $f$ has a
  local maximum at $(0,0)$.  Then what must be true about $f$?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{When $x$ is small enough, the sign of $f'(x)$ and $x$ agree}
    \choice{When $x$ is small enough, the sign of $f'(x)$ and $-x$ agree}
    \choice[correct]{Neither of these statements must be true}
  \end{multipleChoice}
