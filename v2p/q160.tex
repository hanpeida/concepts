  Suppose $f$ and $g$ are continuous functions on the domain $[0,1]$.  When $x < 1/2$ then $f(x) \geq \frac{1}{2} g(x)$.  When $x > 1/2$ then $f(x) \geq 2 g(x)$.  How do the average values of $f$ and $g$ on the interval $[0,1]$ compare?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{The average value of $f$ is smaller than (and cannot equal) the average value of $g$}
    \choice{The average value of $f$ is smaller than or equal to the average value of $g$}
    \choice{The average value of $f$ could be equal to or larger than the average value of $g$}
    \choice[correct]{The average value of $f$ is larger than (and cannot equal) the average value of $g$}
  \end{multipleChoice}
