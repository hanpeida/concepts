	Let $f$ be the function defined by $f(x) = x+1$, and $g$ be the function defined by the rule $g(u) = \frac{u^2-1}{u-1}$. 
	\begin{multipleChoice}
		\choice[correct]{Since $f$ and $g$ have differing domain, they are different functions}
		\choice{$f$ and $g$ are the same function}
		\choice{$f$ and $g$ are different functions because they disagree for some inputs in their common domain}
		\choice{$f$ and $g$ are different functions because they are of different variables}
