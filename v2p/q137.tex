\begin{problem}
  Consider the graph of $y = f(x)$ and the graph of $y = f(x)^2$.  How many local minimums appear on these graphs?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{These two graphs have the same number of local minimums.}
    \choice{The graph of $y = f(x)^2$ has at least as many local minimums as the graph of $y = f(x)$ and could have more}
    \choice[correct]{The graph of $y = f(x)$ has at least as many local minimums as the graph of $y = f(x)^2$ and could have more}
  \end{multipleChoice}
