\begin{problem}
  For a certain function $f$ with domain consisting of all real
  numbers, it is the case that $f(x) < 0$ and yet $f$ is increasing.
  What must be true of $f$?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{The graph of $f$ has a horizontal asymptote at $y = 0$}
    \choice{When $x$ is very negative, $f(x)$ is also very negative}
    \choice{The graph of $f$ has a horizontal asymptote at $y=N$ for some negative number $N$}
    \choice[correct]{None of these statements need be true}
  \end{multipleChoice}
\end{problem}
