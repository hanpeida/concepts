\begin{problem}
  Consider a rectangle $R$ which is $2 \times 1$ and a square $S$
  which is $\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2}$.  What is true about $R$ and
  $S$?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice[correct]{The square $S$ can be cut up into pieces and rearranged to form $R$.}
    \choice{Because $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational, it is not possible to cut $S$ into pieces to form $R$.}
    \choice{Because integration involves a limit, it is not possible to cut $S$ into pieces to form $R$.}
  \end{multipleChoice}
