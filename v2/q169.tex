  Consider $g(n) = \int_{-1}^1 \cos(x^n) \, dx$.  When $n$ is very large, what is a good guess for $g(n)$?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{When $n$ is large, $g(n)$ is close to $0$}
    \choice[correct]{When $n$ is large, $g(n)$ is close to $1$}
    \choice[correct]{When $n$ is large, $g(n)$ is close to $2$}
    \choice{When $n$ is large, $g(n)$ is close to $2 \sin 1$}
    \choice{When $n$ is large, $g(n)$ is close to $\sin 1$}
  \end{multipleChoice}
