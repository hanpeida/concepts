\begin{problem}
  Suppose $f$ is a continuous function which has a local minimum at $(0,f(0))$ and at $f(1,f(1))$.  What must be true about $f$?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice[correct]{There is some value of $x$ so that $(x,f(x))$ is a local maximum}
    \choice{There is some value of $x$ so that $(x,f(x))$ is a global minimum}
    \choice{There is some value of $x$ so that $(x,f(x))$ is a global maximum}
    \choice{None of these statements are necessarily true.}
  \end{multipleChoice}
