	Suppose $f(x) = \log(x+1) - \log(x)$.  What is true about $f$?
	\begin{multipleChoice}
       \choice{When $x$ is very large, $f(x)$ is very large.}
       \choice[correct]{When $x$ is very large, $f(x)$ is close to $0$.}
       \choice{When $x$ is close to $0$, $f(x)$ is close to $1$.}
       \choice{When $x$ is close to one, $f(x)$ is close to $0$.}
