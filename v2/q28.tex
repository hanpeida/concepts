  Suppose $f(x) = x \sin^2 x$.  What is true about $f$?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice[correct]{When $x$ is close to zero, $f(x)$ is close to zero.}
    \choice{When $x$ is very large, $f(x)$ is very large.}
    \choice{When $x$ is very negative, $f(x)$ is very negative.}
    \choice{When $x$ is close to one, $f(x)$ is close to one.}
