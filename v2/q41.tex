\begin{problem}
	I start with $0.3$.  I add $0.03$ to it.  Then I add $0.003$.  Then $0.0003$.  I keep adding numbers for a very long time.  What happens to the sum as I add more terms?
	\begin{multipleChoice}
		\choice{The sum gets very large.  If I went long enough, the sum would surpass $10$}
		\choice[correct]{The sum never gets very large.  It would never surpass $1$, no matter how many terms I summed}
		\choice{The sum of the terms gets closer to $0$}
	\end{multipleChoice}
