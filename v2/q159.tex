\begin{problem}
  Suppose $f$ and $g$ are continuous functions on the domain $[0,1]$.  When $x < 1/4$ then $f(x) < g(x)$.  When $x > 1/4$ then $f(x) > g(x)$.  How do the average values of $f$ and $g$ on the interval $[0,1]$ compare?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{The average value of $f$ is smaller than the average value of $g$}
    \choice{The average value of $f$ is equal to the average value of $g$}
    \choice{The average value of $f$ is larger than the average value of $g$}
    \choice[correct]{There is not enough information to compare the averages of $f$ and $g$}
  \end{multipleChoice}
