\begin{problem}
  Suppose $f$ is a continuous function.  For positive $a$, define $g$ by the rule $g(a) = \int_0^a f(x/a) \, dx$.
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice[correct]{$g(2)$ is twice $g(1)$}
    \choice{$g(2)$ is the same as $g(1)$}
    \choice{$g(2)$ is half as big as $g(1)$}
  \end{multipleChoice}
