\begin{problem}
  Suppose $x$ is $0.00\dots 0017$ with $10^{17}$ zeroes after the
  decimal point, and suppose $y$ and $z$ are large positive integers
  with $y > z$.  Which is larger: $A = \frac{\sin (yx)}{zx}$ or
  $B = \frac{\sin (zx)}{yx}$?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice[correct]{$A$ is larger than $B$.}
    \choice{$B$ is larger than $A$.}
  \end{multipleChoice}
