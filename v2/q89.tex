\begin{problem}
  From far away, the graph of $f$ looks like the straight line
  $y = x$.  Close up, it looks very wiggly.  To be precise, $f(x) - x$
  is very close to zero.  What can be said about $f'(x)$?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{The derivative $f'(x)$ is close to $\sin x$.}
    \choice{The derivative $f'(x)$ is close to $0$.}
    \choice{The derivative $f'(x)$ is close to $1$.}
    \choice[correct]{None of these statements are true}
  \end{multipleChoice}
