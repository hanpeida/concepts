  Suppose a function $f$ has no global maximum value.  What is true of $f$?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{$f$ has infinitely many local minima.}
    \choice{$f(x)$ can be made as large as desired by choosing appropriate $x$}
    \choice{$f(x)$ can be made as small as desired by choosing appropriate $x$}
    \choice[correct]{None of these statements are true.}
