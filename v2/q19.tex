	Let $f$ and $g$ be two functions satisfying the relationship $f(x+3) = g(x)$.  Suppose the point $(0,0)$ is on the graph of $f$.
	\begin{multipleChoice}
		\choice[correct]{The point $(-3, 0)$ is on the graph of $g$}
		\choice{The point $(3, 0)$ is on the graph of $g$}
		\choice{The point $(0, 3)$ is on the graph of $g$}
		\choice[correct]{The point $(0,-3)$ is on the graph of $g$}
