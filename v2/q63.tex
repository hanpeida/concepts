\begin{problem}
  Suppose $f$ is a function with the following properties:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $f(x) > 0$,
  \item when $x$ is very large, $f(x)$ is close to $0$, and
  \item when $x$ is close to zero, $f(x)$ is close to $1$.
  \end{itemize}
  When $x$ is a small positive number, what do you expect to be true about $1/f(1/x)$?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{It is very negative}
    \choice{It is close to $-1$}
    \choice{It is close to $0$}
    \choice{It is close to $1$}
    \choice[correct]{It is very large}
  \end{multipleChoice}
\end{problem}
