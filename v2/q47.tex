\begin{problem}
  Pick some positive real number; add one; take its square root, and
  then add one and take the square root of that, and then add one and
  again take the square root of that, and so on---thousands and
  thousands of times.  Call the result $x$.  What do you expect to be
  true of $x$?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{The number $x$ is close to $0$.}
    \choice{The number $x$ is close to $1$.}
    \choice[correct]{The number $x$ is between $1$ and $2$.}
    \choice{The number $x$ is very large.}
