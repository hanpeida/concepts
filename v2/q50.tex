  % "This seems difficult without advanced knowledge of sine."  I agree, but I really intend students to make the less than careful observation that \(sin x \approx x\) when \(x\) is close to zero, and so the \(\frac{\sin \sin x}{x}\) is about \(x/x = 1\).  The point of including $\pi^{-1000}$ is to see if students believe $\sin \pi = 0$ means $\sin \pi^{-1000} = 0$.
  When $x = \pi^{-1000}$, what number below is closest to $\frac{\sin \sin x}{x}$?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{$-1$}
    \choice{$0$}
    \choice[correct]{$1$}
    \choice{This quantity is undefined}
  \end{multipleChoice}
