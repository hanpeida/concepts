\begin{problem}
  Suppose $x, y, z$ are positive quantities which are depend on time
  $t$.  If $x$ and $y$ are related by the rule $\sin x + \sin y = 1$ and $y$
  and $z$ are related by the rule $\cos y + \cos z = 1$ and $x$ is
  increasing, then what is true about $z$?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{$z$ must be increasing}
    \choice[correct]{$z$ could be either increasing or decreasing}
    \choice{$z$ must be decreasing}
  \end{multipleChoice}
\end{problem}
