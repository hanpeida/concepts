  Suppose $f$ and $g$ are differentiable functions and $f(0) = 0$ and
  $g(0) = 0$ and when $h$ is close to zero, $f(g(h))$ is close to $6h$
  and $g(g(h))$ is close to $9h$.  What is a good approximation for $f(f(h))$?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{$f(f(h))$ is close to $2h$}
    \choice{$f(f(h))$ is close to $3h$}
    \choice[correct]{$f(f(h))$ is close to $4h$}
  \end{multipleChoice}
\end{problem}
