\begin{problem}
  Consider the function $f(x) = \log_{10} \log_{10} \log_{10} x$.  On my calculator, I notice that $f(10^{100}) \approx 0.3$.  What is true about $f$?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{No matter how large $x$ is, $f(x) \leq 10$}
    \choice[correct]{By making $x$ large enough, $f(x)$ could be as large as we desire}
    \choice{By making $x$ large enough, $f(x)$ could be as close to $0$ as we desire}
    \choice{By making $x$ large enough, $f(x)$ could be as close to $\frac{1}{3}$ as we desire}
  \end{multipleChoice}
