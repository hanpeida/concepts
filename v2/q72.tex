	%Seems difficult to rephrase without calculus words.
  Suppose $f$ is a function and that $\lim_{h \to 0^{+}} f(h) = \lim_{h \to 0^{-}} f(h)$.  What is true about $f$?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice[correct]{The function $f$ need not be continuous at $0$.}
    \choice{The function $f$ is continuous at $0$ because the left and right hand limits agree.}
  \end{multipleChoice}
