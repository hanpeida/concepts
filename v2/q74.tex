\begin{problem}
  Suppose $f$ is a function so that whenever $0 \leq x \leq 1$ then
  $0 \leq f(x) \leq 1$.  Moreover, for all $y$ between $0$ and $1$
  there is some $x$ so that $f(x) = y$.

  Now I pick two $a$ and $b$ between $0$ and $1$ so that $a \approx b$.  How does $f(a)$ compare to $f(b)$?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice[correct]{$f(a)$ need not be approximately $f(b)$}
    \choice{$f(a)$ must be approximately $f(b)$}
  \end{multipleChoice}
\end{problem}
