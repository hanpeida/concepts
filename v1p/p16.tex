\begin{problem}

  Say a function ``misses zero'' if there is no number $x$ so that
  $f(x) = 0$.  What is true about functions which miss zero?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{If a function $f$ misses zero, then $1/f(x)$ can be made as large as desired.}
    \choice[correct]{There are functions which miss zero, and yet for all $x$, it is the case that $1/f(x) < 1$.}
    \choice{The quantity $1/f(x)$ is undefined for functions $f$ which miss zero.}
    \choice{If a function misses zero and is positive at one point, then it must be positive at all points.}
  \end{multipleChoice}
\end{problem}
