A team in the Ohio State math department is studying the effectiveness
of our calculus courses, and \textbf{we need your help.}  To measure
what is being learned over the course of the semester, we will offer
two online assessments.  This, the first, is a pre-test; later in the
term you will take a post-test.

You are not expected to study for these assessments.  Between today
and Friday night, you should complete this online pre-test.  It will
take about 20 minutes and should be completed in one sitting.  The
post-test will be administered similarly at the end of the term.

Many of the ``conceptual'' questions on the exam will be new and you
may not know how to solve them; this is by design.  Your responses
will help us improve in the future.  Please try your best to answer
and the complete the questions until the Progress Bar is filled in.

We will award your 2 points for your making your best effort on this
first assessment.
