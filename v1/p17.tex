\begin{problem}

  For a certain increasing function $f$ with domain consisting of all
  real numbers, it is the case that $f(x) < 0$ and it is the case that
  whenever $a < b$ we have $f(a) < f(b)$.  What must be true of $f$?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{The graph of $f$ has a horizontal asymptote at $y = 0$.}
    \choice[correct]{The graph of $f$ has a horizontal asymptote, but not neccessarily at $y=0$.}
    \choice{When $x$ is very negative, $f(x)$ is also very negative.}
    \choice{None of these statements need be true.}
  \end{multipleChoice}
\end{problem}
