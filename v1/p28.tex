\begin{problem}

  Suppose the position of a particle at time $t$ seconds is given by
  the function $p(t) = t^2$.  How does the average $A$ speed of the
  particle between 0 and 1 seconds compare to its instantaneous speed
  $S$ at 1 second?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice[correct]{$A < S$}
    \choice{$A = S$}
    \choice{$A > S$}
    \choice{It depends on the position of the particle.}
  \end{multipleChoice}
